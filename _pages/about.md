  <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Welcome</h2>

  Hello! I’m a Research Assistant and PhD student in the Department of Foreign Language Education at Middle East Technical University (METU), Türkiye.

  My research focuses on English-medium instruction, corpus-based approaches to language teaching, teacher education, and the integration of technology in ELT.

  This website brings together my research, academic interests, and student resources.
